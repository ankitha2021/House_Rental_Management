# House Rental Management
**Purpose of the Project**
A house rental management database serves the purpose of efficiently organizing and
managing information related to rental properties. A user can find properties according
to his needs and contact the owner. The interface directly connects the property owners
and the interested buyers directly without the need for any intermediaries such as agents.

**Scope of the Project**
This project aims to cover the house renting lifecycle, from property listing and
management to user interactions. It includes features such as property listings,
appointment scheduling, rent details and reviews.
